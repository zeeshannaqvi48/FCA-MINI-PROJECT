            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Self-awareness among Gen Z survey helps us to examine how they define
                and perceive self-awareness and how it relates to their daily lives. The
                survey seeks to identify factors that include social media, family, friends,
                education, and to investigate the relationship between self-awareness and
                mental health. In an effort to better understand the habits and attitudes, we
                conducted a google survey of respondents aged 17-30. The survey aimed
                to explore the ways in which Gen Z expresses themselves, the factors that
                influence self-expression, and the role of social media in shaping their
                identities.
            </p>
            <p> OBJECTIVE<br>
                The goal of this report is to gain a deeper understanding of self- expression
                among Gen Z, examining various forms and the factors that influence it.
                Using a google survey, we collected data from a sample of Gen Z individuals
                and analyzed it using excel, employing formulas, graphs and statistical
                techniques to identify trends and patterns. We also utilized set theory
                concepts such as union, intersection, and venn diagrams, to visualize the
                relationships between different variables and identify areas of overlap and
                divergence. By leveraging these analytical methods, this report provides
                insights into the self-expression habits and attitudes of Gen Z, and offers
                recommendations for educators, marketers, and mental health professionals
                seeking to support and promote self-expression among this generation.
